## About [PuerHub](${OFFICIAL_SITE})

PuerHub focuses on exploring and developing in the fields of blockchain and artificial intelligence, committed to providing innovative and reliable solutions for various industries as much as possible.

## About [PuerHub AI](${OFFICIAL_URL})

PuerHub AI, as a relay/aggregation AI service, is dedicated to providing stable and economical AI solutions.

What is a Relay?

When using some AI service providers, issues such as slow access speeds or even inability to access services frequently occur. PuerHub AI acts as a bridge by forwarding user requests to the nearest AI service provider's origin servers through globally distributed service nodes, enhancing the efficiency and speed of content transmission. This enables anyone to enjoy stable and fast AI services. PuerHub AI solely acts as a relay, ensuring the nativity, integrity, and compatibility of the AI service providers' services.

What is Aggregation?

PuerHub AI aggregates services from multiple AI providers, allowing users to use several AI services on a single platform without the need to switch between different providers. AI service providers categorize users, with paying users gaining earlier access to more advanced and diverse services. PuerHub AI aggregates services that are only available to paying users, enabling everyone to experience the latest AI technology. In simple terms, PuerHub AI can be seen as an AI service mirror site with aggregation capabilities.
